[Click here to see the project](https://kamilenver.github.io/checkout-Form/) <br><br>

In this project I used:

- HTML and CSS to lay the page out.

- I tried to use what I have learnt so far like flexbox layout and grid layout.

- I learned how to change HTML content by using Javascript DOM.

- I learned how to react to HTML DOM events.

- I learned how to add and delete HTML elements.

- This project was so beneficial to me.
